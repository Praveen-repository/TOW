    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        In 1982, the new executive committee after overhauling the administration of this
        Federation had it registered as a Society under the Act of 1860.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new management committee of Tug of War Federation of India headed by Mr. Gautam
        Kaul, Asiad Jyoti Awardee of the 9th Asian Games in New Delhi 1982, with Mr. Hari
        Shankar Gupta, Youth Leader of Delhi and Mr. Madan Mohan (National Youth Awardee),
        took upon itself the responsibility of also organizing regular national championship
        for men & women in different age groups e.g. Senior, Junior under 19 Years, Sub
        Junior under 17 Years and open for all ages. These championships were initially
        limited to two weight categories alone. In each of the National Championship fixtures,
        an average of about 575 sports persons participated drawn from all parts of the
        country having their original membership in clubs, and then created into provincial
        teams
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1991, the General Association of National Sports Federation India (GANSF) gave
        its approval to induct the Tug of War Federation of India as its latest member.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1993 the Minister of Sports, Government of India, Mr. Mukul Wasnik formally released
        the new rules book published by the Tug of War Federation of India.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1998, the Department of Internal Revenue also examined the records of the Federation
        and the background of each of the principle officials of the Federation at the national
        and provincial levels and investigated their integrity and previous game experience.
        The Government agencies also scrutinized the application of this Federation for
        approval, and cleared it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1999, impressed with the work that was being conducted in expanding the base
        of the game within the country, and the fact that there was a continuity in promotion
        of the game, which by now had an all India representation in practice, a move was
        made to get the Government of India to recognize the Tug of War Federation of India
        as the National Sports Federation which had been also instrumental in reviving this
        Indian indigenous sport . The Indian government accorded formal approval.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sept 1999 the Indian Railway gave its recognition to the Tug of War Federation of
        India. The Indian Railways extends a 75 percent fare concession to players and officials
        of Tug of War Federation of India while traveling for participating in Tug of War
        events all over the country.
    </p>
    <p>
        Government of India in its official recognition to the Tug of War Federation of
        India also agreed to provide for future, financial assistance for the promotion
        of the game in a modest manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Until the game remained outside the recognition of the Olympic movement there was
        no government support, or help from the industry to provide any sponsorship and
        yet this Federation managed to slowly and slowly build up its national infrastructure.
        In the attached map the India , we are showing the venues where the game's National
        Championships were conducted to date.
    </p>

        at the provincial level in all parts of the country.
